<h1>The best movies according to Ivana</h1>

<h2>M top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>This is by far my favourite movie. It contains all of the elements that I like in movies, mistery, si-fi an action. 
  The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious of 
  his targets. He is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased, as payment for the implantation of another 
  person's idea into a target's subconscious.</p>

<h3>The Great Gatsby</h3>
<p>Oh, this is the one that got me into thinking how far would one go to win someones heart.  Set in the Jazz Age 
  on Long Island, near New York City, the novel depicts first-person narrator Nick Carraway's interactions with 
  mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and Gatsby's obsession to reunite with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan.</p>

<h3>The Hangover</h3>
<p>If you wanna a good laugh this is one to go. It tells the story of Phil Wenneck (Cooper), Stu Price (Helms), 
  Alan Garner (Galifianakis), and Doug Billings (Bartha), who travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party to celebrate 
  Doug's impending marriage. However, Phil, Stu, and Alan wake up with Doug missing and no memory of the previous 
  night's events, and must find the groom before the wedding can take place.</p>
